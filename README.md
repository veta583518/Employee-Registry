## Usage

To start this application run `node index` from your root directory. This is a CLI application and most of your interaction will take place at the command line. Once the application is started you will be prompted as the manager to answer some questions about yourself. Then you have the option to build your team. You will be asked the role of the employee that you wish to add to your team. From there you will be prompted with questions about wach team member that you add. When you have completed entering all of your team members select build team. This will generate your team's profile. Enjoy!
